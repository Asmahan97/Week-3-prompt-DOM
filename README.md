# Week 3: DOM Manipulation

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-1ha2re)

In this week's workshop, we worked on DOM manipulation and learned how to make a website more interactive. This was a great introduction into the practical application of functions in a website. It was really fun to see how a function I'd written translated into an actual feature that users could interact with.

This was certainly the most challenging prompt so far and I had some difficulties trying to understand and bridge the gap between having written a function and then creating a feature users could interact with using that function. The discord group came in handy here as the other applicants were able to offer some great advice that helped me figure out the problem in the end. 

This is still an area I need to work on as subsequent prompts related to Dom Manipulation were still a challenge.
